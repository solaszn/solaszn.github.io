                    <p>There has been a significant shift in the ease of getting loans thanks to private lenders however
                        this of course came with its problems. Several loan apps use unethical practices, impose
                        exorbitant interest rates and are not self serviceable.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this engagement was to refine the loan application and repayment process as well as
                        design an identity that drives growth with trust and credibility.</p>

                        advantage. These include their launch dates, product offerings, as well as their customer’s
                        feedback and unmet needs. Working together with the client on this was crucial to identify

                        to be the most intuitive, informing the use of a floating action button to initiate the
                        repayment process. This approach minimizes the number of clicks required and makes it easy for

                        flow. We noticed participants often read the agreement in desperation as it was a key
                        requirement for approval. To solve this, the secure PIN was used as a universal authenticator on
                        the app and the terms were instead linked on the page.</p>
